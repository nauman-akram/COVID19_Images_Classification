# Image_classification (PyTorch)
Detecting corona-virus (Covid-19) Infections in Chest X-Ray images through Transfer Learning

<h7> Using Vgg-16 and ResNet-18 pretrained models from pytorch and finetuning just only fully-connected layer of network at first so that they can learn on the learned filters of ImageNet and detect the difference between infected and normal person’s X-ray.
